With the rapid development of the IoT technologies and widely spreading in most of the fields such as buildings, health, education, transportation and agriculture. Thus, the IoT applications require increasing data collection from the IoT devices to send these data to the applications or servers which collect or analyze the data, so it is a very important to secure the data and ensure that do not reach a malicious adversary. This paper reviews some attacks in the IoT applications and the security weaknesses in the IoT environment. In addition, this study presents the challenges of IoT in terms of hardware, network and software. Moreover, this paper summarizes and points to some attacks on the smart car, smart home, smart campus, smart farm and healthcare.","Zeyad Mohammad,Zeyad Mohammad,Thaer Abu Qattam,Thaer Abu Qattam,Kholoud Saleh,Kholoud Saleh,Kholoud Saleh",2019 IEEE Jordan International Joint Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (JEEIT),2019
10.1007/s40747-022-00765-y,,,"Authorization schemes for internet of things: requirements, weaknesses, future challenges and trends","Abstract Scalable and secure authorization of smart things is of the crucial essence for the successful deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). Unauthorized access to smart things could exacerbate the security and privacy concern, which could, in turn, lead to the reduced adoption of the IoT, and ultimately to the emergence of severe threats. Even though there are a variety of IoT solutions for secure authorization, authorization schemes in highly dynamic distributed environments remain a daunting challenge. Access rights can dynamically change due to the heterogeneous nature of shared IoT devices and, thus, the identity and access control management are challenging. This survey provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of the current state-of-the-art IoT authorization schemes to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Then, it defines the most important requirements and highlights the authorization threats and weaknesses impacting authorization in the IoT. Finally, the survey presents the ongoing open authorization challenges and provides recommendations for future research.","Abid Khan,Abid Khan,Awais Ahmad,Awais Ahmad,Mansoor Ahmed,Mansoor Ahmed,Jadran Sessa,Jadran Sessa,Marco Anisetti,Marco Anisetti",Complex & intelligent systems,2022

The network mostly consists of heterogeneous devices, each having different protocols. The technology is evolving and bringing many new IoT devices into the market. IoT devices help users to lead a convenient life because of their capabilities such as processing, storage, and networking. It also helps in the field of automation, healthcare, and data analytics. However, the security of the IoT network is still a concern for the developers and users. The heterogeneous nature of the network makes it difficult for the developers to safeguard the network. On the other hand, it opens a wide range of opportunity for the attackers to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system. Some of the major attacks are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man In The Middle (MITM) and replay attacks. As the human elements are integrated with the IoT infrastructure, it is important to consider the security of the data and the operation of the device. The evolution of modern technologies leads to modern threats and attacks on the network, increasing the need for strict security and preventive measures. This paper presents the possible vulnerabilities in the modern IoT network along with their countermeasures to prevent them from the perspective of software, hardware, and network infrastructure. The overview could help the reader to gain insight into the IoT network threats and security.","G.

In practical applications, however, the IIoT has many attack surfaces. As a result, the IIoT is vulnerable to kinds of attacks, including physical attacks (such as the invasive hardware attacks, side-channel attacks and reverse-engineering attacks), malicious code (such as Trojans, viruses and runtime attacks), and other attacks (such as phishing and sabotage). To ensure the security and privacy of the IIoT, many countermeasures have been proposed, a non-exhaustive list includes authentication techniques, secure routing techniques, intrusion detection techniques, signature techniques, and key establishment techniques. As a fundamental countermeasure, key establishment has been extensively and intensively studied. In this chapter, we will present a survey and taxonomy of the key establishment protocols. Specifically, we will review the conventional key establishment protocols which are designed at higher layers and the physical layer. By reviewing the conventional key establishment protocols, we aim to illustrate the necessity of designing cross-layer key establishment protocols for the IIoT. Then, we will provide the detailed review of cross-layer key establishment protocols. The review illustrates that, the cross-layer design enables the IIoT devices to establish communication keys without the trusted entity and the secret sharing assumption. At the end of this chapter, we will provide a conclusion and point out some future research trends of the IIoT.","Yuexin Zhang,Yuexin Zhang,Yuexin Zhang,Yuexin Zhang,Xinyi Huang,Xinyi Huang,Xinyi Huang,Xinyi Huang",Security and Privacy Trends in the Industrial Internet of Thing,2019
10.1109/comst.2019.2953364,,1910.13312,Security of the internet of things vulnerabilities attacks and countermeasures,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) constitute one of the most promising third-millennium technologies and have a wide range of applications in our surrounding environment. The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various applications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low production cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation, autonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in sensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the Internet. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e. there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big concern to the scientific community. Besides, recent integration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: ""Passive Attacks"" and ""Active Attacks"". Understanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help to pave a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology.","Ismail Butun,Patrik Österberg,Houbing Song",arXiv: Cryptography and Security,2019
10.1109/jas.2022.105860,,,Detecting vulnerability on IoT device firmware: A survey,"Internet of things (IoT) devices make up 30% of all network-connected endpoints, introducing vulnerabilities and novel attacks that make many companies as primary targets for cybercriminals. To address this increasing threat surface, every organization deploying IoT devices needs to consider security risks to ensure those devices are secure and trusted. Among all the solutions for security risks, firmware security analysis is essential to fix software bugs, patch vulnerabilities, or add new security features to protect users of those vulnerable devices. However, firmware security analysis has never been an easy job due to the diversity of the execution environment and the close source of firmware. These two distinct features complicate the operations to unpack firmware samples for detailed analysis. They also make it difficult to create visual environments to emulate the running of device firmware. Although researchers have developed many novel methods to overcome various challenges in the past decade, critical barriers impede firmware security analysis in practice. Therefore, this survey is motivated to systematically review and analyze the research challenges and their solutions, considering both breadth and depth. Specifically, based on the analysis perspectives, various methods that perform security analysis on IoT devices are introduced and classified into four categories. The challenges in each category are discussed in detail, and potential solutions are proposed subsequently. We then discuss the flaws of these solutions and provide future directions for this research field. This survey can be utilized by a broad range of readers, including software developers, cyber security researchers, and software security engineers, to better understand firmware security analysis.","Xiaotao Feng,Xiaotao Feng,Xiaogang Zhu,Xiaogang Zhu,Qing-Long Han,Qing‐Long Han,Wei Zhou,Zhou Wei,Sheng Wen,Sheng Wen,Yang Xiang,Yang Xiang",IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2022
,,2111.02388,A Survey of Machine Learning Algorithms for Detecting Malware in IoT Firmware,"This work explores the use of machine learning techniques on an Internet-of-Things firmware dataset to detect malicious attempts to infect edge devices or subsequently corrupt an entire network. Firmware updates are uncommon in IoT devices; hence, they abound with vulnerabilities. Attacks against such devices can go unnoticed, and users can become a weak point in security. Malware can cause DDoS attacks and even spy on sensitive areas like peoples' homes. To help mitigate this threat, this paper employs a number of machine learning algorithms to classify IoT firmware and the best performing models are reported. In a general comparison, the top three algorithms are Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers. Deep learning approaches including Convolutional and Fully Connected Neural Networks with both experimental and proven successful architectures are also explored.","E.

They are extensively applied to various fields of social activities, and concerning manufacturing, they are a key enabling concept for the Industry 4.0 ecosystem. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices share common vulnerabilities with standard IoT devices, which are increasingly exposed to the attackers. As such, connected industrial devices may become sources of cyber, as well as physical, threats for people and assets in industrial environments. In this work, we examine the attack surfaces of a networked embedded system, composed of devices representative of those typically used in the IIoT field. We carry on an analysis of the current state of the security of IIoT technologies. The analysis guides the identification of a set of attack vectors for the examined networked embedded system. We set up the corresponding concrete attack scenarios to gain control of the system actuators and perform some hazardous operations.

Network and system administrators must correctly identify which devices are functional, need security updates, or are vulnerable to specific attacks. IoT profiling is an emerging technique to identify and validate the connected devices’ specific behaviour and isolate the suspected and vulnerable devices within the network for further monitoring. This paper provides a comprehensive review of various IoT device profiling methods and provides a clear taxonomy for IoT profiling techniques based on different security perspectives. We first investigate several current IoT device profiling techniques and their applications. Next, we analyzed various IoT device vulnerabilities, outlined multiple features, and provided detailed information to implement profiling algorithms’ risk assessment/mitigation stage. By reviewing approaches for profiling IoT devices, we identify various state-of-the-art methods that organizations of different domains can implement to satisfy profiling needs.

We make link-layer attacks on BLE (fuzzing, jamming) and cross-protocol injections, with only software modifications. We also attack proprietary protocols on commercial devices like keyboards and ANT-based sports monitoring devices.

A Survey of Practical Security Vulnerabilities in Real IoT Devices,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly spreading, reaching a multitude of different domains, including personal health care, environmental monitoring, home automation, smart mobility, and Industry 4.0. As a consequence, more and more IoT devices are being deployed in a variety of public and private environments, progressively becoming common objects of everyday life. It is hence apparent that, in such a scenario, cybersecurity becomes critical to avoid threats like leakage of sensible information, denial of service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized network access, and so on. Unfortunately, many low-end IoT commercial products do not usually support strong security mechanisms, and can hence be target of—or even means for—a number of security attacks. The aim of this article is to provide a broad overview of the security risks in the IoT sector and to discuss some possible counteractions. To this end, after a general introduction to security in the IoT domain, we discuss the specific security mechanisms adopted by the most popular IoT communication protocols. Then, we report and analyze some of the attacks against real IoT devices reported in the literature, in order to point out the current security weaknesses of commercial IoT solutions and remark the importance of considering security as an integral part in the design of IoT systems.

  the Wild","Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as the connection between places and physical objects (i.e., things) over the internet/network via smart computing devices. We observed that IoT software developers share solutions to programming questions as code examples on three Stack Exchange Q&A sites: Stack Overflow (SO), Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. Previous research studies found vulnerabilities/weaknesses in C/C++ code examples shared in Stack Overflow. However, the studies did not investigate C/C++ code examples related to IoT. The studies investigated SO code examples only. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of all IoT C/C++ code examples shared in the three Stack Exchange sites, i.e., SO, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. From the 11,329 obtained code snippets from the three sites, we identify 29 distinct CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) types in 609 snippets. These CWE types can be categorized into 8 general weakness categories, and we observe that evaluation, memory, and initialization related weaknesses are the most common to be introduced by users when posting programming solutions. Furthermore, we find that 39.58% of the vulnerable code snippets contain instances of CWE types that can be mapped to real-world occurrences of those CWE types (i.e. CVE instances). The most number vulnerable IoT code examples was found in Arduino, followed by SO, and Raspberry Pi. Memory type vulnerabilities are on the rise in the sites. For example, from the 3595 mapped CVE instances, we find that 28.99% result in Denial of Service (DoS) errors, which is particularly harmful for network reliant IoT devices such as smart cars. Our study results can guide various IoT stakeholders to be aware of such vulnerable IoT code examples and to inform IoT researchers during their development of tools that can help prevent developers the sharing of such vulnerable code examples in the sites.

A Scalable Tool for Assessing Replay Attack Vulnerabilities on Consumer IoT Devices,"Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices often leverage the local network to communicate with the corresponding companion app or other devices. This has benefits in terms of efficiency since it offloads the cloud. ENISA and NIST security guidelines underscore the importance of enabling default local communication for safety and reliability. Indeed, an IoT device should continue to function in case the cloud connection is not available. While the security of cloud-device connections is typically strengthened through the usage of standard protocols, local connectivity security is frequently overlooked. Neglecting the security of local communication opens doors to various threats, including replay attacks. In this paper, we investigate this class of attacks by designing a systematic methodology for automatically testing IoT devices vulnerability to replay attacks. Specifically, we propose a tool, named REPLIoT, able to test whether a replay attack is successful or not, without prior knowledge of the target devices. We perform thousands of automated experiments using popular commercial devices spanning various vendors and categories. Notably, our study reveals that among these devices, 51% of them do not support local connectivity, thus they are not compliant with the reliability and safety requirements of the ENISA/NIST guidelines. We find that 75% of the remaining devices are vulnerable to replay attacks with REPLIoT having a detection accuracy of 0.98-1. Finally, we investigate the possible causes of this vulnerability, discussing possible mitigation strategies.","Sara Lazzaro,Vincenzo De Angelis,A.
